    <blockquote>
  <p><em>MOLD IS A FUNGUS</em> that grows in warm, damp conditions. The most common types of household molds are found in basements, bathroooms, drywall, ceiling tiles, carpet, wallpaper, under sinks, and around plumbing pipes. Molds spread by spores that can be airborne or come to rest on surfaces. If you’re sensitive to mold and inhale a large number of spores, you could experience health problems. Moisture control prevents household mold.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="mold-and-human-health">Mold and Human Health</h2>

<p>When someone has mold in their home, they usually show allergy-related symptoms like coughing, sneezing, sore throat, runny nose, sinus headaches, wheezing, difficulty breathing, itchy eyes, and irritated skin. Children, seniors, and people with weaker immune systems are most vulnerable to the negative health effects. Residents of homes with mold are also at an elevated risk for both respiratory infections and bronchitis.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure whether your symptoms are caused by mold, go outside and leave your home. If your symptoms get better, there is a good chance mold is the culprit.</p>

<h2 id="mold-prevention">Mold Prevention</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fix leaking roofs and pipes</li>
  <li>Use ventilation extractor fans in bathrooms, kitchens, and laundries</li>
  <li>Insulate house to create a dry indoor environment</li>
  <li>Install and maintain gutters and downspouts to effectively direct rainwater from the house</li>
  <li>Provide drainage to remove water from the foundation</li>
  <li>Keep wet towels off the floor</li>
  <li>Avoid the use of carpets in bathrooms and basements</li>
  <li>Use a dehumidifier or an air conditioner during warm months</li>
</ul>

<p>Landlords don’t have specific legal mandates to prevent mold, but they are responsible for <em>STRUCTURAL</em> issues as listed above.</p>

<h2 id="mold-stinks">MOLD STINKS</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Large mold infestations can usually be seen or smelled.</p>

  <p><em>WARNING SIGNS</em> include a persistent musty odor and visible signs like small black spots or signs of water damage such as: water stains, discoloration on walls, floors, or ceilings, bubbling or peeling paint and wallpaper.</p>

  <p>Simply painting over mold is not going to solve the issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-can-tenants-do">What can tenants do?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Document household mold problems in writing and with pictures</li>
  <li>Document health concerns and trips to your doctor</li>
  <li>Obtain a written statement from your doctor if diagnosed with a mold-related illness or allergy</li>
  <li>Contact local code enforcement to determine the landlord’s responsible</li>
  <li>Notify your landlord, file a claim in court, and hold your rent in escrow until mold-causing problems are fixed (see <a href="communitylegalaid.org">communitylegalaid.org</a>)</li>
  <li>Talk to your neighbors and organize a tenants coalition</li>
</ul>

<p>Tenants who believe they have been harmed by the presence of mold can try to recover damages from their landlord in court. If a judge or jury agrees that the landlord negligently created a mold problem or allowed the problem to continue, the landlord could be liable for any damage done to your property or health.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>FOR EXAMPLE</em>, a tenant in Tobyhanna, PA sued her landlord in 2011, claiming that high concentrations of mold triggered a bronchial infection causing her to be hospitalized. The jury found the landlord liable and awarded the tenant $150,000 in damages. (Bodon/Soto vs. Cohen, PA Superior Court 2011).</p>
