Mold is a fungus that grows in warm, damp conditions. The most common types of household molds are found in basements, bathrooms, drywall, ceiling tiles, carpet, wallpaper, under sinks, and around plumbing pipes. Mold is spread by spores that can be airborne or come to rest on surfaces. If you're sensitive to mold and inhale a large number of spores, you could experience health problems. Moisture control prevents household mold.
